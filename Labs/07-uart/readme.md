## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

1. Use schematic of the [LCD keypad shield](../../Docs/arduino_shield.pdf) and find out the connection of five push buttons: Select, Left, Up, Down, and Right.

2. According to the connection, calculate the voltage values on pin PC0[A0] if one button is pressed at a time. In this case, the voltage on the pin is given by the [voltage divider](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/voltage-divider-calculator/), where resistors R3, R4, R5 and R6 are applied successively.

3. Calculate the voltage value if none of the push buttons is pressed.

4. Calculate the ADC values for these voltages according to the following equation if reference is Vref=5V and number of bits for analog to digital conversion is n=10.

   | **Push button** | **PC0[A0] voltage** | **ADC value (calculated)** | **ADC value (measured)** |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
   | Right  | 0&nbsp;V | 0   |  |
   | Up     | 0.495&nbsp;V | 101 |  |
   | Down   |       |     |  |
   | Left   |       |     |  |
   | Select |       |     |  |
   | none   |       |     |  |
