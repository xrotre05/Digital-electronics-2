# Lab 2: Control of GPIO, LED, push button

## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

1. Draw two basic ways to connect a LED to the output pin of the microcontroller: LED active-low, LED active-high.

| **LED color** | **Supply voltage** | **LED current** | **LED voltage** | **Resistor value** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| red | 5&nbsp;V | 20&nbsp;mA | | |
| blue | 5&nbsp;V | 20&nbsp;mA | | |
